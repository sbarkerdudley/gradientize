### React Assets

#### Components

I built the bulk of the UI in about 2 days with the immense help of [Mantine.dev](https://github.com/mantinedev). I found it extremely intuitive and fast to *compose* a polished-looking app quickly. The styling API is a bit more work to get the hang of, and I mostly found myself making on-the-fly inline CSS changes as needed. Overall, I highly recommend the component library.

#### Hooks

- `useColor` - uses [Fast Average Color](https://github.com/fast-average-color/fast-average-color) to sample the average color in *RGB* of incoming images (album covers, playlist images, artist profile photos, etc). The `getColorAsync` method returns a promise, and an object of various formats of the sampled *RGB* color. Sometimes the color can be muddy when there is no dominant color, or the average is influenced by contrasting colors. The `getHue` method converts the `[ R, G, B ]` { value } property returned by `getColorAsync` and parses it into an integer where `0 <= n <= 360`. This format can be concatenated into an `hsl(${int}, 100%, 50%)` string to be used as a color property in CSS.

[hsl()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl()) and [hsla()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsla())

| `abbr.` | for | type/value range | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `h` | hue | 0 <= `int` <= 360 | value representing the pure hue of the `hsl` color |
| `s` | saturation | `'0%'` <= `string` <= `'100%'` | 100% saturation reflects a pure hue |
| `l` | lightness |  `'0%'` <= `string` <= `'100%'` | 50% is the pure hue, *100%* is white, *0%* is black |
| (`a`) | alpha | 0 <= `float` <= `1` | optional opacity when using the `hsla()` constructor. 0 is transparent, 1 is opaque |
